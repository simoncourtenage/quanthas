QuantHas project is an attempt to port QuantLib C++ code to the functional programming language Haskell.

This project is a work in progress.  Much of the code written so far is in draft form.  The approach taken so far has been
to read through the Quantlib C++ code and work out the best way to represent it in Haskell.  This is not the best approach,
because it is fairly bottom-up.  But once a significant part of the code has been translated, and the translation problem better
understood, the architectural aspects will be revisited.

Any questions, please contact me via email (see profile).
